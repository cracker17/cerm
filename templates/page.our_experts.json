Scientists now believe we may cure ageing in our lifetime. We want to keep you as youthful as possible until they do. At the forefront of longevity and anti-ageing research is a compound called Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN).<\/p>\n<br>\n<p>NMN is a compound that is converted into NAD+ in the body. NAD + is the battery recharger of the mitochondria, the cellular engines that power every organ in the body from the skin, to the heart, to your liver. The heart has 5,000 mitochondria per heart cell and human brain cells can contain 2,000,000 mitochondria per cell. You want to supply these batteries with as much “juice” as possible. Since NAD+ diminishes in the body as we age, and replenishing it is key in promoting longevity and youth at a cellular level.<\/p>","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/20210721_145847_2_1920x_ff569bd7-7af9-4c4f-a452-98bef5f7287c.png","image_mob":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/20210721_145847_2_1920x_ff569bd7-7af9-4c4f-a452-98bef5f7287c.png"}},"1657946637a86561bd":{"type":"ethics_section","disabled":true,"blocks":{"e390bc12-a6bc-44de-86b1-97950e423a34":{"type":"quality","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/fleur-kaan-w4Dj3MshHQ0-unsplash_1920x_4cc72827-7cc2-43ea-8568-0d62d58048bc.png","anim_heading":"Seed to Capsule","anim_caption":"Vertical integration from R&D to finished product ensures we have control over transparency and consistency in our products."}},"d585f47c-8a9b-40e1-81d8-65216bc41629":{"type":"quality","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/chris-lee-70l1tDAI6rM-unsplash_1920x_07b76824-0ca3-4a3e-bdd5-564acce9c4e2.png","anim_heading":"Crowd Research","anim_caption":"Cutting-edge research is a community effort.
